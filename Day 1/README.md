## UNIX Fundamentals

The session commenced with an introduction to the UNIX operating system, covering the following topics:

### Introduction to UNIX
- **Definition**: UNIX was introduced as a robust, multiuser, and multitasking operating system known for its reliability and extensive use in development and production environments.
- **Comparison**: The performance and robustness of executing code via Command Line Interface (CLI) were compared to Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Key UNIX Commands
Essential commands that are a prerequisite for every developer were demonstrated:

#### File Management
- **Commands**:
  - `ls`: List files and directories.
  - `cp`: Copy files and directories.
  - `mv`: Move or rename files and directories.
  - `rm`: Remove files or directories.
  - `touch`: Create empty files.

#### Navigation
- **Commands**:
  - `cd`: Change directory.
  - `pwd`: Display the current directory.
  - `find`: Locate files in the filesystem.

#### Process and System Management
- **Commands**:
  - `ps`: Display currently running processes.
  - `kill`: Terminate processes by their PID.
  - `top`: Monitor system resources and processes in real-time.

#### File Permissions
- **Concept**: The significance of file ownership and access control was explained.
- **Commands**:
  - `chmod`: Modify file permissions.
  - `chown`: Change file ownership.

Practical scenarios and use cases for these commands were discussed, emphasizing their role in efficient system management and development practices.

## Git and GitHub

The latter half of the session focused on Git, a distributed version control system, and its integration with GitHub, a platform for collaborative development. The key concepts discussed included:

### Core Git Theory
- **Version Control**: A foundational understanding of version control systems and how Git facilitates efficient tracking of code changes.
- **Branches**: The concept of branches was introduced, highlighting their role in isolating feature development and bug fixes.
- **Merge Conflicts**: Techniques for handling merge conflicts, including identification and resolution strategies, were discussed.

### Best Practices
- Maintain clean commit histories.
- Write meaningful commit messages.
- Ensure consistent collaboration across teams.
- Analyze and resolve common challenges during deployments and production updates.

### GitHub Features and Usage
GitHub's role in simplifying repository management and team collaboration was emphasized, with specific features discussed:

#### Pull Requests (PRs)
- **Process**: Step-by-step guidance on creating, reviewing, and merging PRs to ensure smooth and error-free code integration.

#### Collaboration Tools
- Use GitHub’s features to facilitate peer reviews, inline code discussions, and team-wide adherence to coding standards.

#### Branch Visualization
- Benefits of tools like GitHub Desktop for graphically visualizing branch structures and histories, aiding in repository organization.

Practical insights into GitHub's integration into the company’s processes were provided, emphasizing its role in tracking changes and enhancing productivity.
